# WASSUP

## Problem

I write reports every week. I had started attention that I spend a lot of time to do this. First of all, I try to remember what I did this week (I fixed this problem with iCal). Secondly, I spend a lot of time to copy-paste from iCal to my Notes. I understood that I need some tool that helps me optimize my time with this process.

## Motivation

This is a pet-project to get new programming skills and learning something new tools.

Also, I want to make something helpful for yourself and maybe to other people :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
